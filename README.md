## 🧩 React Fundamentals

This project leverages essential React concepts:

- **Components and Props**: For creating reusable and dynamic components like ProductCard, Navbar, and FilterSidebar.
- **State and Lifecycle**: Manage application state (cart, wishlist, product filters) using `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **React Router**: For smooth navigation between pages (Home, Product Details, Cart, Wishlist).
- **Context API**: To provide a global state for cart and wishlist management.
- **Conditional Rendering**: For showing different UI elements based on user actions or state.

## 📊 Data Management

- **State Management**: Implemented using **Local Storage** to handle cart and wishlist data.
- **Local Storage**: Used for persisting data like the shopping cart and wishlist across browser sessions.
